# Go API Server for openapi

This is a sample Pet Store Server based on the OpenAPI 3.0 specification.  You can find out more about
Swagger at [https://swagger.io](https://swagger.io). In the third iteration of the pet store, we've switched to the design first approach!
You can now help us improve the API whether it's by making changes to the definition itself or to the code.
That way, with time, we can improve the API in general, and expose some of the new features in OAS3.

_If you're looking for the Swagger 2.0/OAS 2.0 version of Petstore, then click [here](https://editor.swagger.io/?url=https://petstore.swagger.io/v2/swagger.yaml). Alternatively, you can load via the `Edit > Load Petstore OAS 2.0` menu option!_

## Overview
This server was generated by the [openapi-generator]
(https://openapi-generator.tech) project.
By using the [OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification) from a remote server, you can easily generate a server stub.

### Running the server

To run the server, follow these simple steps:

```
go run main.go
```

To run the server in a docker container
```
docker build --network=host -t openapi .
```

Once the image is built, just run
```
docker run --rm -it openapi
```

### Known Issue

Endpoints sharing a common path may result in issues. For example, `/v2/pet/findByTags` and `/v2/pet/:petId` will result in an issue with the Gin framework. For more information about this known limitation, please refer to [gin-gonic/gin#388](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin/issues/388) for more information.

A workaround is to manually update the path and handler. Please refer to [gin-gonic/gin/issues/205#issuecomment-296155497](https://github.com/gin-gonic/gin/issues/205#issuecomment-296155497) for more information.
